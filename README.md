## About the Project

As I proceed in my career as a web developer, I will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are typically a combination of multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. As a bootcamp student, I want to build a code quiz application with multiple-choice questions on JavaScript that stores high scores so I can gauge my progress compared my peers. 

## Client's Requirements

Initial design of the app has the following deliverables:

GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
